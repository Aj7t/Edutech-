            <p>  NCERT Solutions for Class 10 Science Chapter 1 – Chemical reactions and equations is an outstanding study resource needed for the students studying in CBSE Class 10. These NCERT Solutions are crafted as per the latest CBSE syllabus 2020-21 by subject experts at BYJU’S. It is very important for the students to solve and study the NCERT solutions to get knowledge of the type of question asked on the Chemical reactions and equations chapter.
               Chapter 1 of Class 10 Science mainly deals with writing chemical equations, writing and balancing chemical equations. 
               In this chapter, students also learn the basics of chemical reactions, their types and effects of a chemical oxidation reaction in our
                daily lives. This solution provides an overview of the main concepts in the chapter and helps you to get well versed with important topics such as writing 
                chemical equations and balancing them.NCERT Class 10 Science Chapter 1 has good weightage and there will be around 4 questions being asked every year from this chapter.
                Types of questions that appear in this chapter are mostly practice-based questions. Thorough knowledge and good practice will help you score 
                full marks on the questions asked from this chapter.  </p> <br>

           <div class="align">
               <p> 1. <strong> Matter-</strong> Matter is anything which occupies space and has mass is called matter. Air and water, sugar and sand, hydrogen and oxygen etc. Matter is made up of very small tiny particles. Particles of matter have space between them they attract each other.</br>
                  2.<strong> Classification-</strong> On the basis of physical properties, matter is classified as solids, liquids and gases. On the basis of chemical properties, matter is classified as elements, compounds and mixtures.<br>
                 •  Solids- Solids have strong molecular force and a definite shape and size solids can neither flow nor be compressed.<br>
                 •  Liquids- Liquids have weak intermolecular flow and large intermolecular spaces. Liquids do not have a definite shape but can flow.<br>
                 •  Gases- Gases have weak intermolecular flow, high compressibility, and no definite shape and volume.<br>
                  </p>  At the most fundamental level, matter is composed of elementary particles, known as quarks and leptons (the class of elementary particles that
                   electrons). Quarks combine into protons and neutrons and, along with electrons, form atoms of the elements of the periodic table,
                   such as hydrogen, oxygen, and iron. Atoms may combine further into molecules such as the water molecule, H2O. Large groups of atoms or molecules 
                   turn form the bulk matter of everyday life.
                   Depending on temperature and other conditions, matter may appear in any of several states. At ordinary temperatures, for instance, gold is a solid, 
                   water is a liquid, and nitrogen is a gas, as defined by certain characteristics: solids hold their shape, liquids take on the shape of the container that 
                  holds them, and gases fill an entire container. These states can be further categorized into subgroups. Solids, for example, may be divided into those with 
                  crystalline or amorphous structures or into metallic, ionic, covalent, or molecular solids, on the basis of the kinds of bonds that hold together the constituent
                  atoms. Less-clearly defined states of matter include plasmas, which are ionized gases at very high temperatures; foams, which combine aspects of liquids and solids;
                  and clusters, which are assemblies of small numbers of atoms or molecules that display both atomic-level and bulklike properties</p>

               Magnesium ribbon should be cleaned before burning in air because Magnesium metal reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and forms Magnesium Oxide (MgO) 
               layer which is a very stable compound. In order to prevent further reactions with Oxygen, 
               it is therefore necessary to clean the ribbon by to remove the layer of MgO.

            Reaction Between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an example of double displacement reaction. During the reaction negative and
             positive ions trade positions as a result in the formation of white silver chloride precipitate. The chemical reaction is given below.<br>
